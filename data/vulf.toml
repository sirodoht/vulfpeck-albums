  Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love
  Pale moon is casting shadows from above

  Poinciana, somehow I feel the jungle heat
  Within me, there grows a rhythmic, savage beat

  Love is everywhere, it's magic perfume fills the air
  To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care

  Poinciana, from now until the dawning day
  Our love will live forever and a day,

  Blow tropic wind, sing a song through the tree
  Tree sigh to me, soon my love I will see

  Lyrics —

  mom said wait for the moment
  gone home went to bed
  while the other kids, they're still outside

  I don't feel time when I sleep
  so I snuggle up with my sheet
  and wait for a brighter day

  I'll play football tomorrow
  with only my best friends
  people I like, but I don't love are not allowed

  I wonder if Sharon will see me
  but I'll play cool
  cause cool is what you have to do

  it's hard to make a point
  when you're living so loud
  turn it down

  trying to get my friend excited
  about not being invited
  I say that's an opportunity

  butt dialed I smiled
  listen dialed I smile
  It was so nice to get a call
